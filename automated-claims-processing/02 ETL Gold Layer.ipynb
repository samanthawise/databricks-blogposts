I've had some unexpected expenses come up and I'll probably need to defer for about 3 months. I see. I'm going to review your eligibility for a payment deferral. Can you please hold for just a moment? Thank you for holding, Ryan. I've reviewed your account and it looks like you may be eligible for a payment deferral. I'm going to go over the next steps with you. We'll need to set up a new payment plan that will take into account your current financial situation. That sounds great, thank you. You're welcome, Ryan. I'm going to send you an email with the details of your new payment plan and you can also view it online through your account. If you have any questions or concerns, don't hesitate to reach out to us. Okay, got it. Just to summarize, we've discussed your premium payment deferral and I've reviewed your eligibility.

I'm calling because I've recently experienced an income loss and I was wondering if it's possible to lower my coverage temporarily. I'm so sorry to hear that, Riley. For security, can I confirm your date of birth and policy number? My DOB is 31st December 1988, and my policy number is VG263766. Thank you for confirming, Riley. I understand that you're going through a tough time financially and you'd like to adjust your coverage. Can you tell me a bit more about what you're looking for in terms of temporary adjustments? Well, I'm not sure what options are available, but I was hoping to reduce my premium payments for the next few months until I get back on my feet. I completely understand, Riley. Let me see what we can do for you. We do have a temporary adjustment option that might be suitable for your situation. I can offer to reduce your coverage for a period of 6 months, which would lower your premium payments. However, please note that this would also affect the level of coverage you receive. That sounds like it could work for me. What would be the new premium amount? Let me just check that for you... Okay, with the temporary adjustment, your new premium would be £100 less per month. Would that be acceptable for you? Yes, that would be a big help. What do I need to do to confirm the changes? I'll go ahead and process the temporary adjustment to your policy. You'll receive a confirmation email with the updated details. Is there anything else I can assist you with today? No, that's all. Thank you so much for your help. You're welcome, Riley.
