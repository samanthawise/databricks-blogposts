Adjusting your coverage level could reduce your premium, but it would also affect the amount of coverage you have.

(pause) Yes, we can discuss adjusting your policy coverage temporarily. This would involve reducing your premium payments, but it would also mean some changes to the benefits you're currently receiving. That sounds like it could work for me. What kind of changes to my benefits are we talking about? The adjustments would primarily affect your outpatient and dental coverage.

         "Hello, thank you for calling VitalGuard. My name is Agent. How can I assist you today? Hi, this is Amelia Rodriguez. I was hoping to get some help with a billing and premium question. Of course, Amelia. For security, can I confirm your date of birth and policy number? Sure, my DOB is 16th November 1990, and my policy number is VG716131. Thank you for confirming. What kind of billing and premium questions do you have? I want to know why my premium has increased. Let me check that for you... It seems that the premium increase is due to a change in your age bracket and an adjustment in our pricing structure. However, I can offer you some options to reduce your premium. That would be great, thank you. One option is to adjust your coverage level or add a deductible. I can also check if you are eligible for any discounts. Would you like me to explain these options in more detail? Yes, please. I'd be happy to explain. Adjusting your coverage level could reduce your premium, but it would also affect the amount of coverage you have. Adding a deductible would also lower your premium, but you would need to pay that amount out of pocket before your coverage kicks in. As for discounts, we offer a range of discounts for things like being a non-smoker or having a healthy lifestyle. That helps, thank you. You are very welcome. Is there anything else I can assist you with today? No, that is all for now. Great! Just to summarize, I have explained the reason for your premium increase and offered some options to reduce your premium. If you need further assistance, don’t hesitate to reach out. Have a wonderful day! Thanks! You too. Goodbye!",

What kind of billing and premium details are you looking for? I want to know why my premium has increased and how I can manage my billing payments. Let me check that for you... It seems your premium increase is due to a change in your health insurance plan. I can assist you with managing your billing payments. We offer various payment options, including monthly direct debit or annual payment. Which one would you prefer? I think I would like to switch to monthly direct debit. Can you help me with that? I can assist you with setting up a monthly direct debit. I will guide you through the process. Please confirm your bank account details, and I will take care of the rest. That sounds great, thank you! You are welcome. Is there anything else I can assist you with today? No, that is all for now. Great!

Yes, there was a slight adjustment in your premium due to changes in your age bracket. I can walk you through the details and explain the new billing amount. That would be great, thank you. I've explained the changes to your premium and the reasoning behind the new billing amount. Is there anything else I can assist you with today? No, that's all for now. Thank you for your help.
