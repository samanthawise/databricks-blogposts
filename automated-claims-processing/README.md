## 🧪 `demo/` – Internal Demo Version

> ⚠️ Intended **only for internal demo purposes**, not for customer distribution.

This version demonstrates the **end-to-end analytics capabilities at scale**, simulating transcription output to:
- Showcase AI enrichment (sentiment, NER, classification, summarization)
- Visualize patterns across **larger volumes of call data**
- Power the **front-end dashboard** with meaningful insights

### 🔧 Key Notes:
- Includes **sample audio files** in the Bronze layer.
- Uses **`resources/generate_data.py`** to create a **Silver layer** with **simulated transcriptions**.
- Supports **bulk application** of Databricks AI Functions (sentiment, summarization, topic classification, etc.).
- Ideal for **live demos** and showcasing **dashboard interactivity**.

### 🧩 Use Case:
Great for illustrating how insights scale when applying AI functions across calls in a customer service environment.

## 🤝 `customer/` – Shareable Version

> ✅ This is the version meant to be **shared directly with customers**.

The `customer/` directory contains the **clean version of the solution accelerator**, which:
- Includes **sample `.m4a` audio files** for ingestion
- Walks through the **complete, realistic pipeline**:
  - Bronze Layer: Raw ingestion of audio
  - Silver Layer: Format conversion, duration calculation, transcription using Whisper
  - Gold Layer: AI enrichment via Databricks AI Functions and LLMs

### 🔧 Key Notes:
- No simulated data — all transcriptions are generated from real sample audio using **OpenAI Whisper**.
- Ensures full **transparency and reproducibility**.
- Designed to show **how customers can adopt the pipeline** with their own audio sources and extend the AI use cases.
